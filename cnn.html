        <h2>Projects / Hardware Convolutional Neural Network</h2>
        <p>I designed and built in verilog a convolutional neural network for image processing. It was a multi stage network with the first 
            stage being a convolution layer, second being a Relu function layer, and last being a max pooling layer. Through this project I learned 
            skill of design before coding, advanced debugging skills using modelsim and synopsys compiler when we synthesized our design.</p>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>This project was the final project for my ASIC Design class. Below I included images of my final submission with a drawing of my design
            as well as my project writeup. My code is avaliable upon request.
