        <h2>Experience / RC4 Assembler</h2>
        <p>
            I worked at at RC4 wireless for a little over 3 years, my first year being an assembler. During my time as an assembler I mastered soldering with a soldering iron as well as doing advanced repairs with hot plates and a hot air tool. I did microprocessor
            swaps and did complex repairs on parts all the way down to 0402 size. I also worked in multiple high stress timelines doing repairs for customers. I stayed at RC4 for 2 additional years as a production manager.

        </p>
        <br>

            I gained practical experience in the following:

            <li>Hot Air tool</li>
            <li>Advanced repairs including microprocessor swaps</li>
        </ul>
