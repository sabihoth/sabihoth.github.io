        <h2>Experience / RC4 Production Manager</h2>
        <p>
            I worked at RC4 wireless for a little over 3 years, my last 2 years being as an industrial production manager. While working this position I worked on looking over the CNC machine, PNP machine, laser cutter, as well as projections of part ordering and
            repairs. I managed the assemblers, giving them tasks and delegating repairs to them as needed, leaving the more complex repairs to myself. My day-to-day consisted of forecasting orders that are coming in to plan the ordering of parts and assembling
            of the many boards. I also attended trade shows representing the company including LDI in Vegas where I had to communicate with customers and other industry professionals. When covid hit I was forced to work from home and started documenting
            all of the processes for setting up and running machine as well as writing of training materials for future employees. This included lots of technical writing and technical documentation.
