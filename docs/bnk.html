        <h2>Experience / BNK</h2>
        <p>
            I worked as a summer intern at Bass Nixon and Kennedy (BNK) the summer between me graduating from Wake Tech and me entering NCSU. I used Revit and Autocad to work on power systems of new and existing developments. I worked in both site lighting small
            projects to new construction of a 500-unit apartment building. I got experience in single and three phase power systems. I also got experience in reading and interpreting electrical code. I did many electrical surveys of existing conditions
            for both fire alarm and electrical.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I gained proficiency in the following softwares:
        </p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px ;list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Revit</li>
            <li>AutoCAD</li>
            <li>Visual</li>
            <li>Bluebeam</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I gained practical experience in the following:
        </p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px ;list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Electrical Surveying</li>
            <li>Generators</li>
            <li>1 + 3 phase power systems</li>
            <li>Interpretation of Electrical Codes</li>
        </ul>
