        <h2>Projects / Mechanical keyboards</h2>
        <p>Mechanical keyboards have been one of my hobbies for many years. It involves creating, designing and building mechanical keyboards. This hobby requires quite a few skills. You have to do research into exactly what you want, making sure that all
            of the parts work together, it also requires hardware knowledge of circuits and then software knowledge of C code. </p>

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Mechanical keyboards originally interested me because I was a big fan of typing on them. Soon after I got my first one I learned that there was a massive DIY community that is passionate about building their own keyboards. Multiple communities
            wrote embedded code and made it open source known as
            <u><a class="no-arrow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware"> QMK </a></u>. This community is massive and also released schematics for numerous types of keyboards. There are many different types of layouts for keyboard
            from full-size with a number pad that most are used to, all the way down to a 40% ortholinear keyboard like I made below.
        </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>

            <p>The picture to the left is an image of the
                <u><a class="no-arrow" target="_blank"  href="https://olkb.com/collections/planck"> Planck </a></u>keyboard. The Planck is an ortholinear keyboard that comes as a kit where you receive all of the parts but then you need to solder it and
                program it yourself. The newest version of the Planck also includes a spot for a rotary encoder which can be programmed to have numerous functions. After receiving this kit I added my own switches and soldered them in. I then bought keycaps
                and wrote C code that I flashed to the keyboard. Writing your own C code for the keyboard allows for you to write your own keymap for it.

            <p>This next keyboard is another one that I built. The case for this keyboard was cut myself using a CNC router. The wood used for this was reclaimed wood from a North Carolina tobacco factory. This board was also programmed using the QMK software
                as well.

            <p>This is an image of one of the keyboards that I built in the fairy pools of scotland. I brought it along so I could take pictues of my keyboard in the many spots I visited during my trip to Scotland.</p>
